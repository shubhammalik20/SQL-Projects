## Data Cleaning

Before data exploration some data cleaning steps are performed which helps in better analysis of the data.

- Generate some additional columns which were used during analysis such as age-band,segment etc
- Removing null values

## Data Exploration
With help of SQL I tried to answer the following question.

- What day of the week is used for each week_date value?

- What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?

- How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?

- What is the total sales for each region for each month?

- What is the total count of transactions for each platform

- What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?

- What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?

- Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?

- Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?
